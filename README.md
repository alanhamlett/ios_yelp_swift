# Yelp - Assignment 2

A Yelp search app.

Submitted by: Alan Hamlett

Time spent: [coming soon][time spent coding]

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

### Search Results Page

* [X] Table rows should be dynamic height according to the content height.
* [X] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints.
* [ ] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does). Hint: This is just a UISearchBar that is set as the navigationItem.titleView

### Filter Page

* [ ] The filters you should actually have are: category, sort (best match, distance, highest rated), distance, deals (on/off).
* [ ] The filters table should be organized into sections as in the mock.
* [ ] You can use the default UISwitch for on/off states.
* [ ] Clicking on the "Search" button should dismiss the filters page and trigger the search w/ the new filter settings.
* [ ] Distance filter should expand as in the real Yelp app.
* [ ] Categories should show a subset of the full list with a "See All" row to expand.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

### Search Results Page

* [ ] Infinite scroll for restaurant results
* [ ] Implement map view of restaurant results

### Filter Page

* [ ] Implement the restaurant detail page.
* [ ] Implement a custom switch.
